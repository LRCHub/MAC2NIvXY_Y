Crazy world
Full of crazy contridictions, like a child.
First you drive me wild, and then you win my heart
With your wicked art.
One minute tender, gentle, then tempermental as a summer storm.
Just when I believe your heart's getting warmer, you're cold, and you're cruel.

And I like a fool, try to cope, try to hang on, to hope.

Crazy world
Every day the same old roller coaster ride.
But I've got my pride, I won't give in.
Even though I know I'll never win.
Oh, how I love this crazy world.
