I guess it's all illusion that brings me to myself
Myself is clear and painted with the blue
Mad and sunburnt in the rain for a while
Shakes my soul searchin
For the rest
You get it - .
The answeryou get that feel and you say
The answer the answer the answer I'd seen
How could it be so easy now to live this life
In my own dimension with frozen light
You get it - .
The answeryou get that feel and you say
The answer the answer the answer I'd seen
Mindless sittin here this world to see
Stranger like myself to me to me
You get it - .
The answeryou get that feel and you say
The answer the answer the answer I'd seen
Mindless sittin here this world to see
You get it - .
The answeryou get that feel and you say
The answer the answer the answer I'd seen
